<h1>1.4. - 15/10/2020</h1>
 
<p>Today's session satrted with background information about GitHub Branches and commits. We created a new folder for today's session. </p>

<p>I thought today's session started off quite structured, unfortunately it was largely focussed on troubleshooting. There was areas of confusion on what was going to be demonstrated in during the lesson i.e. whether branches are going to be demoed or not.</p>

<pP>I chose to progress via FreeCodeCamp during the lull times and research in jargon that was not initially explained in class.
</p>

<p>I made notes on the video which explained what HTML, CSS and Javascript each contribute to a modern website.</p>
