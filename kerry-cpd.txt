Reflection

This week we used CSS to style HTML, mainly using colour and added sizes to images.
In terms of HTML, I added headings, paragraphs, lists, images and linked to external webpages to open in a new tab.
We created different CSS style sheets and applied to different branches before merging in main.

2.3 - 27/10/2020

I attended the workshop yesterday for clarication on terminology on GitHub (fetch/push). 
I also used the opportunity to fix some of the broken code and mis-linked CSS style sheets.

As part of today's session, I learned more about CSS styling, utilising positions and specifics to target certain parts of my code.
I enjoy Luke's method of teahcing and he had shared some useful resources which I will follow up (mimo, chear sheets and useful CSS reference websites)
