Reflection
 
In today session I was shown GitHub, Git and VS Code. 
We installed an extension onto VS Code (Live Service).

I was introduced to creating my own responsitory on VS Code, cloning this into GitHub and understanding the updates and history of changes.

Reflection

This week we used CSS to style HTML, mainly using colour and added sizes to images.
In terms of HTML, I added headings, paragraphs, lists, images and linked to external webpages to open in a new tab.
We created different CSS style sheets and applied to different branches before merging in main.

2.3 - 27/10/2020

I attended the workshop yesterday for clarication on terminology on GitHub (fetch/push). 
I also used the opportunity to fix some of the broken code and mis-linked CSS style sheets.

As part of today's session, I learned more about CSS styling, utilising positions and specifics to target certain parts of my code.
I enjoy Luke's method of teaching and he had shared some useful resources which I will follow up (mimo, chear sheets and useful CSS reference websites) 

2.3 - 29/10/2020

We continued 2.3 and started on 2.4. The coding is getting more complicated but we touched on margins, border and padding. Luke explained the concepts.
I understoof it a little more by defining the pixels needed for each element and I could see the example more clearly.

2.4 - 03/11/2020

We did more coding on moving images and texts using abolsutely and relative positioning. 
I thought this was more challenging but after Luke demonstrated I understood the concept more. 
We looked at float which is used in older code. This is something I come across during work so this is quite useful.

3.1 - 05/11/2020 

Today we looked at Javascript code, including looking at the inspect element to see the hidden messages.
I also used the pop up (alert) and document write methods. This was a good introduction to JS.
Towards the end of the session I used variables and was introduced to the arithemtic operators.
I did the HTML quiz and achieved a score of 65%.

3.2. - 10/11/2020

We looked at functions today and combined what we learnt last week with variables.
I forget to declare the function and most of my errors lie in the camel case of the code.
I learnt about arguments and how these are used within functions to store and use later. I then executed the console log function in the browser to test my code.
Variable and glocal scope was a little bit confusing. I will need to review Boolean and comparison operators.

3.3 - 12/11/2020

We did a practical session where we reviewed a number of javascript tasks. This was quite difficult, I got a lot of error messages. We looked at switch, breaks and returns.

3.4 - 17/11/2020

Another practical lesson, I found it quite difficult to get the code to work for the arrays and loops, but the concepts made sense. I haven't got this far on FreeCodeCamp yet, but I think this will help when I get to practise it.

Towards the end we looked at objects, but I think I will need to look at this in a webinar session. 

3.5 - 19/11/2020

I watched the recordings of my lessons and Alex's to fix some of my broken code. I also attended the workshop which helped me understand the concepts of arrays and loops.

In today's session we did a practical on shopping carts. It was logical when Luke explained it and I felt more comfortable in the session. 
I will take away the practical and continue to troubleshoot it.

3.6 - 3.7 - 26/11/2020

Last session we looked at the DOM and creating nodes.

In today's session I grouped images in class, and added buttons as filters to separate the different images. I thought this session made more sense than the last one! I spent time fixing my broken code from last session.

3.8 - 01/12/2020

Alex defined what SSGs were and talked about the various programmes and how they operate.
